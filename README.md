# Kops 

## Kubernetes
An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Kops (Kubernetes Operations)
A tool for managing Kubernetes clusters on cloud providers like AWS. It simplifies the deployment, maintenance, and management of Kubernetes clusters.

## Cluster
A set of nodes (machines) that run containerized applications, managed by Kubernetes.

## Node
A worker machine in Kubernetes that runs pods. It can be a physical or virtual machine.

## Pod
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running process in a cluster.

## Deployment
A Kubernetes resource that provides declarative updates to applications, managing the creation and scaling of a set of pods.

## Service
An abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them, enabling communication between different components in a cluster.

## Kops State Store
A persistent storage location, typically an S3 bucket, used by Kops to store the configuration and state of Kubernetes clusters.

## Configuration File
A YAML file generated by Kops that defines the desired state of the cluster, including details about nodes, networking, and services.

## Validation
The process of checking the status and readiness of a Kubernetes cluster after creation or modification.

## Update
The process of applying changes to a Kubernetes cluster's configuration using Kops.

## Cleanup
The process of deleting a Kubernetes cluster and its associated resources to free up cloud provider resources.

## Troubleshooting
The act of diagnosing and resolving issues within a Kubernetes cluster, often involving checking logs and inspecting resource states.
